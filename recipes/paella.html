        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Paella (pai. ei. uh) is a classic Spanish rice dish made with rice, saffron, vegetables, chicken and rabbit, cooked and served in one pan.</p>
        <p>The origin of paella is believed to be in Valencia. A real paella Valenciana is made with chicken and rabbit (and often snails), spiced with sweet paprika and a few strands of golden saffron. And best of all is the socarrat. The slow, undisturbed simmering of the 
            rice in broth means that the bottom layer will start to caramelize.</p>

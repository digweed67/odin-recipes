        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Paella (pai. ei. uh) is a classic Spanish rice dish made with rice, saffron, vegetables, chicken and rabbit, cooked and served in one pan.</p>
        <p>The origin of paella is believed to be in Valencia. A real paella Valenciana is made with chicken and rabbit (and often snails), spiced with sweet paprika and a few strands of golden saffron. And best of all is the socarrat. The slow, undisturbed simmering of the 
            rice in broth means that the bottom layer will start to caramelize.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 chicken cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 rabbit cut into pieces</li>
            <li>300 grams of fresh green beans</li>
            <li>1 tomato</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of sweet paprika</li>
            <li>Saffron</li>
            <li>6 cups of water</li>
            <li>200 grams of Garrafon beans</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>3 cups of rice</li>
            <li>A bunch of rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil over a low flame in the paella pan (wide and shallow receptacle).</li>
            <li>Next, sauté the chicken and rabbit for around 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then add the freshly chopped vegetables, beans, artichokes and grated tomato to the pan. Fry for several minutes until a smooth sauté begins to form.</li>
            <li>Add the paprika and fry over a low flame for one minute after adding the water. Next, add the saffron, garrofon beans and salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Turn up the heat and leave to boil for approximately 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread the rice evenly across the pan and leave to boil for a further 15 minutes and then test the stock. Add salt if necessary.</li>
            <li>During the last 7-8 minutes add the rosemary. Leave it to cook for around 5 minutes before removing it from the pan.</li>
            <li>The paella is cooked when the liquid has evaporated but the mixture is not completely dry.</li>
            <li>In order to achieve the famous socarrat, the crispy caramelised bottom, leave it to cook a little longer over a low flame.</li>
        </ol>
